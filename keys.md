### K3ys

There are 16 of each Tier of Key

Locks such as l0cket require you to know the values of T1 keys. Later locks like l0ckbox & l0ckjaw require you to have them in your upgrade slots and/or loaded

To begin your collection, start with the 8 most common t1 k3ys on the market, and 8 t1 npcs.  Each t1 npc adds one of the remaining k3ys to the market.

Hacking any T1 also gives you access to 16 t2s. *Each T2 adds a T2 k3y to the market*

Hack any T2 to get access to 16 T3s. *Each T3 adds a T3 k3y to the market.*

You can either hack all the things to get all the k3ys to make higher tiers easier, or hope for luck when you loot an NPC
